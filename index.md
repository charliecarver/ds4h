# COVID Prognosticator: COVID-19 Onset and Recovery Detection With Wearable Devices   
## Charlie Carver, Hunter J. Gallant, Viney Regunath, and Ho Man Colman Leung

### Objective

Given the continued relentlessness of COVID-19, proactive detection is essential for long-term management of the disease. Wearable devices offer an elegant solution to this problem, given their ubiquity and rich set of collected data. Prior work has already shown the possibility of using heart rate variability to detect the onset of COVID19 using wearable device data[^r1][^r2][^r3][^r4]. However, little work has been conducted on exploring how other sensing features (e.g., sleep duration, sleep variability) fare at predicting the onset of COVID19, and even less on detecting the recovery of COVID19. This project aims to explore the additional features provided by our dataset[^r5] at both predicting COVID19 onset and recovery.
